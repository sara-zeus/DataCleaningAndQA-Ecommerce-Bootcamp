__QA Process:__
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
 
__Data Validation in 'analytics' Table: Check for invalid dates and NULL price formats.
Validation of 'cleaned_analytics' View: Ensure successful creation of the 'cleaned_analytics' view.
Data Validation in 'all_sessions' Table: Verify NULL city, revenue, and transaction values.
Validation of 'cleaned_all_sessions' View: Confirm successful creation of the 'cleaned_all_sessions' view.
Summary of Data Quality Issues: Provide a summary of identified data quality problems.
Proposed Data Cleaning Actions: Recommend specific actions to address the identified data quality issues.__

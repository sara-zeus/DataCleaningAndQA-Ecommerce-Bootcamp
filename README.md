__Results__
I found correlations between regions and the most popular products ordered, based on weather data. Places that were cooler, warmer clothes were popular and vice versa. 

__Challenges__ 
The challenge of this project is that it is very hard to interpret what each column means in each table. Sometimes, we have to make assumptions about some columns.
__Future Goals__
I would clean the data more and I would do more research about each column name and what they each mean.

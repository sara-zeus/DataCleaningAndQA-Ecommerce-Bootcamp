# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to learn how to clean data and transform CSV files into tables in our PostgreSQL database.

### Project Steps
1. Process
2. Download the CSV files
3. Create tables and transfer data into them
4. Examine each table to identify necessary cleaning
5. Perform data cleaning
6. Analyze and answer questions
7. Complete the remaining tasks of the project

## Results

I discovered correlations between regions and the popularity of products ordered, based on weather data. Cooler places favored warmer clothes, and vice versa.

## Challenges

The main challenge in this project is the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of each column in the tables. In some cases, assumptions had to be made about certain columns.

## Future Goals

In the future, I plan to further clean the data and conduct more research to understand the meaning of each column.

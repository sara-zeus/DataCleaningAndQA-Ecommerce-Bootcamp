## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to learn how to clean data. We also learn how to transform data as csv files into tables in our postgres database. 

1. Process
2. Download the CSV files
3. Create tables and transfer them into tables
4. Look at each table, see what needs to be cleaned
5. Clean data
6. Answer questions
7. Complete the rest of the project


__Results__
I found correlations between regions and the most popular products ordered, based on weather data. Places that were cooler, warmer clothes were popular and vice versa. 

__Challenges__ 
The challenge of this project is that it is very hard to interpret what each column means in each table. Sometimes, we have to make assumptions about some columns.
__Future Goals__
I would clean the data more and I would do more research about each column name and what they each mean.

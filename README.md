# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to learn how to clean data. We also learn how to transform data as csv files into tables in our postgres database. 

## Process
### Download the CSV files
### Create tables and transfer them into tables
### Look at each table see what needs to be cleaned 
### Clean data 
### Answer questions 
### Complete the rest of the projects 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
The challenge of this project is that it is very hard to interpret what each column means in each table. Sometimes, we have to make assumptions about some columns.
## Future Goals
I would clean the data more and I would do more research about each column name and what they each mean.

# Final Project: Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to master the art of data cleansing and transforming CSV files into structured tables within our PostgreSQL database.

### Project Steps
1. Initial processing
2. Retrieval of CSV files
3. Table creation and data migration
4. Thorough examination of each table for necessary cleaning
5. Implementation of data cleansing strategies
6. In-depth analysis and comprehensive response to key questions
7. Successful completion of remaining project tasks

## Results

Through meticulous analysis, I uncovered compelling correlations between geographical regions and product popularity based on weather data. Notably, colder regions exhibited a penchant for warmer clothing items, while the opposite trend prevailed in warmer locales.

## Challenges

The most significant challenge encountered was the complexity associated with interpreting the meanings embedded within each table column. In several instances, assumptions were necessary to navigate certain columns' content.
